## Steps for usage

### Before starting

First, [cURL](https://curl.se/) and [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) are required. And before starting, you need to change some settings in `AdGuardHome.yaml`:

- `upstream_dns_file` **must be** `/usr/share/adguardhome.upstream`.
- `all_servers` **should be** `true`.
- `cache_optimistic` is recommended to be `true`.

<details><summary>What do these options do?</summary>

The option `upstream_dns_file` allows you to loading upstreams from a file, `all_servers` enables parallel queries to all configured upstream servers to speed up resolving, and `cache_optimistic` makes AdGuardHome respond to client from cache first and send new request at the same time to the upstream and update the cache. For more information please read the [AdGuardHome Wiki](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Configuration).

</details>

On most Unix systems you can find the `AdGuardHome.yaml` in `/opt/AdGuardHome`, but on macOS you should go `/Applications/AdGuardHome`, or maybe you can try `find /* -name AdGuardHome.yaml` to find it.

### Get and run the script

At this step, there is the possibility of DNS failure, please clearly understand and pay attention to back up your DNS settings.

```
curl -o "/usr/local/bin/upstream.sh" "https://gitlab.com/fernvenue/adguardhome-upstream/-/raw/master/upstream.sh"
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/upstream.sh
/usr/local/bin/upstream.sh
```

<details><summary>What if I using non-systemd Unix system?</summary>

If you are using AdGuardHome on non-systemd system, just replace the `systemctl restart AdGuardHome` in [upstream.sh](./upstream.sh) to the command that you restart the AdGuardHome. For example in openwrt: `sed -i "s|systemctl restart AdGuardHome|/etc/init.d/AdGuardHome|" /usr/local/bin/upstream`, that's all.

</details>

### Use systemd timer to automate

In the template provided by this repository, the timer is set to call the systemd service **once a day at 5am**.

```
curl -o "/etc/systemd/system/upstream.service" "https://gitlab.com/fernvenue/adguardhome-upstream/-/raw/master/upstream.service"
curl -o "/etc/systemd/system/upstream.timer" "https://gitlab.com/fernvenue/adguardhome-upstream/-/raw/master/upstream.timer"
systemctl enable upstream.timer
systemctl start upstream.timer
systemctl status upstream
```

<details><summary>What if I using non-systemd Unix system?</summary>

Maybe you can use [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to automate it, for example add `0 5 * * * /usr/local/bin/upstream.sh` to the cron configuration, and the configuration file for a user can be edited by calling `crontab -e` regardless of where the actual implementation stores this file.

### How felixonmars's dnsmasq-china-list works?

Using specific upstreams for some domains is a common way to accelerate internet in mainland China. This list collects domains that use NS servers located in mainland China, allowing us to use some DNS servers for them that don't break CDN or geo-based results, while using encrypted and trusted DNS servers for other domains.

### Why it's better than other methods?

On the one hand, for DNS resolution, when the domain's name server is in other region, even if the domain is resolved to an address in mainland China, we can still get the fastest resolution by DNS request from the other region in most cases, you might say that some DNS servers have caches, usually it brings a lot of problems. In fact, AdGuardHome has adopted optimistic caching since v0.107, which is much better than relying on upstream DNS caching. On the other hand, many tests are showing that some of the poisoned results are IP addresses located in anywhere. Therefore, it is impractical to infer whether the result is poisoned by the location of the IP address. This list only includes domains that use NS servers from mainland China, that's why it is better than redir-host or any other similar methods. 

## Something else

### Always use the recommended configuration first

The recommended configurations will be automatically selected and used by the script. These upstreams are carefully selected, they include encrypted and trusted and unfiltered upstreams, and they all have SSL certificates configured on their IP addresses, so there is no need for additional resolution by Bootstrap DNS servers, and they can respond to requests as quickly as possible in parallel request mode. If your network environment is not very special, **DO NOT** change the script or recommended configurations.

### This is not for...

This is **NOT FOR** breaking any network firewall, and in fact it **CAN NOT** be used for that either. It's only used to accelerate internet in mainland China such as improve DNS resolve speed for Chinese domains, get the best CDN or geo-based results and so on, please don't misunderstand it.
