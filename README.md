First of all, you must change the setting to use upstream file.

Find the option `upstream_dns_file` in `/usr/local/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml`,<br>
And it should be `/usr/local/AdGuardHome/upstream.txt`.<br>

For more information about this, please read the official [AdGuardHome documentation](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Configuration).
